# Prerequisites

Chordalysis requires Java 8 (to run) and Ant (to compile); other supporting library are providing in the `lib` folder (with associated licenses). 

# Installing

## Compiling Chordalysis
```
git clone https://github.com/fpetitjean/Chordalysis
cd Chordalyis
ant compile
``` 
## Getting a cross-platform jar and launching the GUI
Simply entering `ant jar` will create a jar file that you can execute in most environments in `bin/jar/Chordalyis.jar`. 
Normal execution would then look like
```java -jar -Xmx1g bin/jar/Chordalysis.jar```
Note that `Xmx1g` means that you are allowing the Java Virtual Machine to use 1GB - althought this is ok for most datasets, please increase if your dataset is large. 

## Running Chordalysis in command line
The `compile` command creates all `.class` files in the `bin/` directory. To execute the demos, simply run:
```
java -Xmx1g -classpath bin:lib/core/commons-math3-3.2.jar:lib/core/jayes.jar:lib/core/jgrapht-jdk1.6.jar:lib/extra/jgraphx.jar:lib/loader/weka.jar demo.RunGUIProof
```
This will run the GUI, which will take you through choosing the different options. 

If you want to run everythin in command line, please run: 
```
java -Xmx1g -classpath bin:lib/core/commons-math3-3.2.jar:lib/core/jayes.jar:lib/core/jgrapht-jdk1.6.jar:lib/extra/jgraphx.jar:lib/loader/weka.jar demo.Run dataFile pvalue imageOutputFile useGUI
```
where:
* `dataFile` represents the path to your dataset in CSV format (eg `/home/doe/mydata.csv`)
* `pvalue` represents the maximum family-wise error rate (FWER); usually `0.05`
* `imageOutputFile` represents the path to the output graph file as an image (eg `/home/doe/mygraph.png`)
* `useGUI` is a boolean used to display the output graph in a GUI or not (eg `false` if you want everything in command line)

There are other demos, allowing you to, for instance, export the probability tables, play with belief propagation, or load a dataset in `.arff` format. Please just contact me if you need help. 

# Chordalysis for R
We now have an R interface for Chordalysis, see:
